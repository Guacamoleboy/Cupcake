# Cupcake

## School Project by Andreas, Ebou & Jonas.

Olsker Cupcakes wants to expand their business and requires an online store
which we must develop. We've been given a specific tasksheet and cases that we 
must / should implement.

## How to run it

Clone or Fork the Project

- Open the Project in IntelliJ and navigate to Database.java.
- Insert your PgAdmin (Postgres) information and you're good to go.
- Add Cupcake and Cupcake_test databases and insert our setup.sql file in both of the databases.
- Add our dummy.sql file into the Cupcake database and you're ready to go.

## Please be aware of

This app is not fully implemented which means stuff like payment isn't added for safety reasons.
The app is only made responsive on IPad 14.7.2 which means loading it on IPhone won't look good.
We have blockers for that, but please be aware that the program is designed for Web & IPad as of right now.

## Thank you
